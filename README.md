# LBTService
Windows Service to convert HID proxy devices to HCI mode, forked from http://code.google.com/p/lbtservice/

Please read this before installing LBTService

This service will automatically switch your compatible Logitech Bluetooth dongle to HCI mode.
In HID mode, the keyboard and/or mouse are paired with the dongle by pressing the small red buttons on both the keyboard/mouse and the dongle. In HCI mode this pairing will not work, instead you will have to pair the keyboard/mouse in the “Add a new Bluetooth Device” dialog. In order to do this you will need another keyboard or at least a mouse connected through USB or PS/2 to complete this paring process. The additional keyboard or mouse is needed only once for the pairing process.
